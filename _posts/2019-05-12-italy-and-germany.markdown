It has been a while since I've updated this blog. I am finding it hard to have the time and inclination to pull out my laptop and write of my experiences, but this feels overdue.

I left Chamonix, France by Flixbus (a very popular means of tranport in Europe when trains aren't possible) on the 29th to arrive in Milan.  It was my first time experiencing Milan, the center of finance and fashion in Italy.  Predicticably, those were not the items of interest in my exploration of the once ancient city.  I say "once ancient" since Milan seems to have had a hard time maintaining its historic monuments amidst the push of foreign incursions and pull of modern capitalism.  Still, there were many momuments, markets and museums to be had.

I left Milan on May 3rd, heading on a 2 hour train to Florence.  Here was a much more preserved city, with its towering churches and tiny, meandering walkways.  Italy cemented itself as my museum-centered country after the few days of fighting through tourists in Florence to see the exhibits of world fame.

I left for Munich on May 6th, the four hour train ride carrying me much more distant in landscape and culture than the time would suggest.  It would be my second time visiting Munich, having stayed in a hostel only two doors down from the one I occupied this time.  As luck would have it, I arrived during the Spring version of the much-touted Octoberfest celebration.  As expected, aside from the typical tourist events and exciting soccer matches, many of my fellow hostel residents and I had our activities centered around this event.  I can only imagine what the larger, Fall celebration would be like.

Finally, I arrived in Berlin on the 9th.  It is a city of immense history.  Although the references to the horrific past are inescapable and in many cases enshrined in memorials, the locals seem to have great hope and optimism for the future of their city.  Their nightlife is world renowned and I had a chance to experience a few different sides of it over the past few days, but my stomach and eardrums could only take so much of the techno-club side.  I'll stick to the more casual, at this point.

I will be heading to Prague tomorrow, a city I've yet to hear a bad thing about.
