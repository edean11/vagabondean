The first few days in Barcelona were great.  Expectedly, solo travel began as a daunting excursion but slowly morphed into an exhilerating one.  The freedom of movement and activities provides an experience unlike my past travels, as designed.

The night I arrived I wandered into the basement level "club" of the hostel I was staying at.  I was met with a crowded room of laughs, brought about by a Catalan-speaking 30-something on stage.  I found one of the few remaining spots where I could still see the stage as body language was the only language I could truly understand at that point.  I strained my faded Spanish knowledge to little avail until the show ended shortly after arriving.

After some stilted conversation with the other club-goers, I was fortunate enough to meet an American wedding photographer who had spent enough time in Barcelona to give some suggestions.  She gave me the rundown of the things I should see and do over drinks at a place around the corner from the hostel.

A nice cafe, with plants covering the back walls and lively-conversations ongoing, was where I had brunch the following morning.  Afterwards, I put my new shoes to the test and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  A short siesta ensued to rest my head and feet, until later that night I met up with some fellow international travelers at a bar about 1.5 miles from my hostel.

The next few days in Barcelona were a whirlwind of sightseeing and people-meeting.  Mercat de la Boqueria, Picasso Museum, Mediterranean Beach, Gothic Quarter, late night cafes, tapas, underground music shows all intermingled with fellow travelers and locals.  

My next stop was Geneva, Switzerland.

Known to be an international and high-end city, Geneva lived up to its reputation.  I only had 2 full days there, but I felt I was able to soak up as much of the city-life as I could in that short time.  I learned of its rich history during a walking tour on the 1st full day I was there.  It has a complex and weaving past that reflects itself not just in the city and its stark contrasts in scenery but also in its people.  I've never witnessed such a complicated mix of cultures and languages.

Finally, I headed off to Chamonix, France by bus (April 25).  Right now, I am sitting on the balcony of my hotel room overlooking the mountain and village vistas.  I will be attending a small music festival here this weekend and perhaps will do some late-season skiing, I suspect my days here will be enjoyable.

PS Picture gallery coming soon.  I still have to take the time to code the gallery components on this site.
