As I was warned, Thailand was liable to grab hold of you and not let go.  I intended on staying a couple weeks but ended up staying until my Visa expired (~30 days).  

Although lacking in some modern amenities, in many ways Thailand felt like a land of plenty.  Plenty to see, plenty to do, plenty to eat.  In short, plenty of ways to spend your time, no matter what your inclinations.

I began the adventure, as many do, in the enormous Bangkok metropolis.  I spent only a few nights there as I had gotten plenty of metropolitan life out of my European travels and I was looking for something a little more remote.  Still, it was worth the few nights stay.

From there, as a backpacker, you essentially have two options: head south to the islands or head north to the mountain escapes.  I decided on the latter, so I ventured north to a town called Chiang Mai.  This was the unofficial northern capital of Thailand.  The night markets here were among the best I encountered, but the highlight of my stay here must have been the elephant sanctuary visit.

From there I hopped on a 3 hour bus to Pai, a town of only 2,000 locals but a haven for backpackers.  Here I stayed for 6 nights, seeing waterfalls, giant statues, hot springs, caves, sunsets at the "canyon", fire shows and many others.  Outside of these things, though, it was simply a nice place to relax by the pool and regain my bearings.

After riding back to Chiang Mai, I caught a flight down to the Thai islands.  My first stop was Koh Phi Phi, made famous as the idealic place the Leonardo DiCaprio movie "The Beach" was filmed at.  It was, admittedly, idealic even if partially overrun by tourists.  My activities here mostly centered around the beach my hotel was situated at.

A day long journey across the Thai mainland to the eastern islands of Ko Tao, Koh Phangan and Koh Samui was next.  Aside from my now usual beachfront relaxing, the first of my two main activities on these islands started with the infamous Full Moon party on Koh Phangan.  It is an all-night beach party of food, drink, neon paint and thumping bass.  Though not particularly my scene, I would be remiss if I was in the area around that time and not go.  The second of my highlights would be getting my Open Water Certification for scuba diving in Ko Tao (images in the gallery).  I was told by many that not only was this one of the best places to dive in the area, it was also the cheapest in terms of attaining the certification.  The certification process lasted 3 days (much shorter than many other places) and I am now certified to do open water dives anywhere in the world.  Well worth the money, in my opinion.

I am now in Danang, Vietnam visiting a few friends I know from my time in Atlanta.  After all the late nights and all day scuba diving, I plan to mostly relax here and enjoy the local cuisine and culture.  It is, amazingly, cheaper than Thailand.  For instance, I was able to get a beachfront view 4 star hotel for around $45 a night.  I plan on doing some of the touristic activities recommended over the next couple days.  I will see whether I head north from here to see Hanoi and Ha Long Bay or just head straight to Japan from Danang.  I was going to do South Korea for a bit, but since I have heard such such good things about the notoriously expensive Japan, I may save the plane and hotel money from South Korea to just have a bit more time in Japan.  My current plans have me returning to the US around July 20th.
