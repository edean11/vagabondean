3 plane rides to begin my expedition.  I had forgotten of the scramble for overhead bin space and disregard for seating zones.  Only the most ambitious and unrelenting among us could claim what we all wanted.  

I lost my final battle and was resigned to check my bag in when it exceeded a never before mentioned weight limit in Newark.  That expense and my back are telling me I brought too much, even though my initial packing felt sparing.  Still, it was a reletively painless experience considering the distance I have traveled.

Barcelona appears as I remember it from my previous trip in my college days.  Overcoming the initial hustle of travel options, I grabbed a taxi and headed to my hostel. The language barrier and my hesitation to toture my driver with broken spanish made the ride quiet.  I believe we passed the exact location of the hostel I had previously stayed at, a far cry from the trendy, city-centered location I was soon to arrive at.

The room I arrived at was quaint and sparse, but the surroundings are everything but.  As I write this, I sit in an intricately adorned room tucked away behind what appears to be a relatively high class restaurant a few floors beneath my room.  A DJ casually sets up his equipment and the techno-house sounds I've come to expect from the bustling European cities has begun playing. I will see what the next few days and nights have to offer.
